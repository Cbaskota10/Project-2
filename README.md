# Project-2

Hangman is a game where players try to guess a word one letter at a time. If the player guesses a letter wrong, then the number of tries left decreases by one everytime. My decrypt function first encrypts the randomly selected word then waits til the user finishes playing the game before it decrypts the secrect word and prints it for the user to see. Decrypt fun convers the encrypted data, which are the list of words, to its oriiginal source format and returns how it was encrypted.
