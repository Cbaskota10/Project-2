Hangman is a game where players try to guess a word one letter at a time. If the player guesses a letter wrong, then the number of tries left decreases by one everytime. My decrypt function first encrypts the randomly selected word then waits til the user finishes playing the game before it decrypts the secrect word and prints it for the user to see. Decrypt function convers the encrypted data, which are the list of words, to its oriiginal source format and returns how it was encrypted. If you win the game and guess all the letters of the encrypted word correctly, then you are congragulated for your achievement and the deecrypted message prints for the user to see after the game is over. If you are unable to guess all the letters in ten tries, you will. lose the game and you will. be prompted with the same printed decryption function. The words in th list are already encrypted and the decrypt function only decrypts the words.
